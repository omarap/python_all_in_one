the .setdefault() value lets you add a new key to a dictionary 
with predefined values.
"""

#Example
"""
An example in which we created the DWC001 dictionary
using the same keys as the product dictionary. 
After the dictionary is created,
setdefault('taxable', True) adds a key named taxable and 
sets its value to True â€” but only if that dictionary 
doesnt already have a key named taxable.
It also adds a key named reorder_point and sets its value to 10 but, 
again, only if that key doesnt already exist.
